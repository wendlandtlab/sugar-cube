# Networks

`networks/network_cdxml.ipynb` contains code that uses the ElementTree package in python to generate a ChemDraw XML file from a set of kinetic parameters. These are used to generate the networks that appear in Figure 3C and 3E. This directory also contains the csv parameter files used for both the alpha and beta networks.
