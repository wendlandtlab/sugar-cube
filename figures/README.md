# Figures

### Introduction

This directory contains some python code to generate figures in the style of the manuscript and SI.

### Networks

`networks/network_cdxml.ipynb` contains code that uses the ElementTree package in python to generate a ChemDraw XML file from a set of kinetic parameters. These are used to generate the networks that appear in Figure 3C and 3E. This directory also contains the csv parameter files used for both the alpha and beta networks.

### Timecourses

`timecourses.ipynb` contains the code that generates the log-scaled timecourses which are used for Figures 4C, 4D and throughout SI section 4.
